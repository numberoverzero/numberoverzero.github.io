title:  "Binary Serialization Mixin: More Metaclasses (Part 4)"
---

### *From the Archives*

*This is a series from my old blog on developing [origami][origami], when I was still planning on using some clever descriptor/metaclass magic.  Most of that was swapped out for performance and maintainability reasons, but it's been a useful reference when I've had to rebuild various magic inspection components*
