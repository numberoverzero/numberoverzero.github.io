</div>
<div class="article-content"><p>In addition to providing a specification for Starcraft II bank signatures, this post also aims to introduce bank files
at a high level, dispel common misunderstandings around signatures and encryption as they relate to banks, and
introduce half-baked proposals for properly securing bank files via additional APIs from Blizzard.</p>
<div class="section" id="background">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>A number of tools exist to modify bank files, but are often incomplete or not user friendly.  These usually only
deal with the Blizzard-provided signing mechanism, which is a SHA-1 of a canonical representation of the bank
contents, player account and map author account numbers, and bank name.</p>
<p>This signature does not prevent local modifications, but is a form of security through obscurity.  Modifying an xml
file by hand is a high bar for most players, even if tools automatically regenerate the signature.</p>
<p>In addition to the signing mechanism, map authors will intentionally obfuscate variable names and values.
In the sample &quot;Hero Survival J&quot; bank file below, there is an int &quot;level&quot; with the value &quot;91&quot; that could easily be
changed to &quot;121&quot; for an increase in power.  A common first step is to rename obvious variables, so that &quot;level&quot; becomes
&quot;boring_variable_a&quot;.  Then, a simple form of obfuscation might be to base64 encode this int as a string and reverse
the process when reading:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">base64</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">level</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sa">b</span><span class="s2">&quot;91&quot;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">base64</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">b64encode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">level</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">b&quot;OTE=&quot;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">base64</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">b64decode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">b</span><span class="s2">&quot;OTE=&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">b&quot;91&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This makes it harder to locate significant values with a casual scan.  Adding unused but similarly named variables will
further increase the time it takes for a user to identify the important keys.</p>
<p>Some authors have opted for full AES encryption through libraries like STARCODE.  Because the encryption secret must
be available to the user's client (usually by unpacking the game triggers) this is nothing more than an expensive
layer of security through obscurity.  If your users have already committed to de-obfuscating variable names in
the bank file, this is a negligible deterrent that they'll sidestep in the process of filtering out useless variables.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Q. What is a bank file used for?</strong></p>
<p>Bank files are simple XML files used to non-durably persist data between sessions in custom games.  They may be used
to track hero progress in an RPG, or inventories or currencies.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Q. What does a bank file look like?</strong></p>
<p>Here's my bank file for Hero Survival J:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;Bank</span> <span class="na">version=</span><span class="s">&quot;1&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/Bank&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Q. Where are they stored?</strong></p>
<p>Blizzard does not offer storage for these files, which means the bank file for one map for battle.net account
may differ across two hosts.  All banks are stored somewhere in your home directory.  Here's the Starcraft II
account root on Windows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
C:\Users\&lt;USER&gt;\Documents\StarCraft II
</pre>
<p>From there, an individual map's bank file will be stored at:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
..\Accounts\&lt;NUMBERS&gt;\&lt;ACCOUNT_NUMBER&gt;\Banks\&lt;AUTHOR_NUMBER&gt;\&lt;BANK_NAME&gt;.SC2Bank
</pre>
<p>Everything after the root is independent of OS.  Once you replace backslashes with forward slashes, the
following python regex should be usable across all platforms:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">re</span>

</pre></div>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Q. What stops me from changing the bank file by hand?</strong></p>
<p>Security through obscurity:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Few users know bank files exist.</li>
<li>Less know where they are stored.</li>
<li>Less know how to open or modify them.</li>
<li>Less know how to sign them.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point you're left with users that have found bank editing tools and trigger extraction tools.  If the author
chooses to obfuscate variable names you can further reduce the list:</p>
<ol class="arabic" start="5">
<li><p class="first">Less know how to step through <tt class="docutils literal">.galaxy</tt> scripts.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Less know how to identify significant variables based on library calls, such as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
PlayerModifyPropertyInt(
    lib1_gv_psave3, c_playerPropMinerals, c_playerPropOperSetTo,
    BankValueGetAsInt(BankLastCreated(), &quot;pmin&quot;, &quot;pmin&quot;)
);
</pre>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Finally, users may need to reconstruct strings for eg. AES decryption by stepping through intentionally
obfuscated code.  This is a non-trivial process that requires parsing and debugging code, often without the
ability to run it (then the bank would fail to validate/the encryption key would not generate properly).</p>

</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="common-misconceptions">
<h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
<p>There's a ton of vocabulary and I won't attempt to cover signing, hashes, and encryption here.  Instead, I'll try to
dispel a few myths and misunderstandings about bank protection that keep coming up.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Signatures are only easy to crack because SHA-1 is weak</strong></p>
<p>The strength of SHA-1 is not relevant here, because our attacker (local user) has access to all of the data
necessary to construct a valid signature.  Consider a signing scheme where instead of SHA-1, bank files are signed
by computing the SHA-256 of the map name and the date.  Even though SHA-256 is &quot;stronger&quot; than SHA-1, it doesn't
matter because everyone has the information necessary to compute the correct signature.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Encoding data as integers will make banks tamper-proof</strong></p>
<p>If you imagine that encoding is translating between languages, then it's immediately obvious that encoding will only
make it harder to find the correct keys and values, but won't prevent users from reversing your process.  There's
nothing special about integers that makes them impossible to read (otherwise, how would we get the data back after
encoding it?).  The best you can do is encode using a secret process that only you know.  Unfortunately, the user's
game must have some way to read the data so you can't keep the process a secret without preventing them from using
that data.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Well, using Actual Real Encryption like AES will make banks tamper-proof</strong></p>
<p>This suffers from the same problem as above; even if you invent your own encoding the game needs some way to decode
the data into a usable format.  You'll need a symmetric key (usually from some password or secret) for AES, which
means the password must live somewhere in the map data (usually the map triggers) and once again the user can simply
extract those and freely modify the values.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>As long as banks live on the user's computer, there's no way to make it tamper-proof</strong></p>
<p>None of the methods mentioned above will do the trick, but there are a number of things that Blizzard can do.  For
example, AES is perfectly fine as long as the secret isn't available to the user.  If the bank file is stored
encrypted on the user's machine with a symmetric key derived from a password that never leaves Blizzard's servers,
you could guarantee that the user can't modify their data without actually storing the data on a Blizzard server.</p>
<p>When the map loads, the user's client would send the bank file to the server asking for a decrypt.  The server looks
up the AES key for the map (optionally per user) and then tries to decrypt the bank.  If the decrypt is successful
it returns the bank file to the user's client, which resumes the normal loading process.</p>
<p>To save the bank, the user's client sends the bank file to the server asking for an encrypt.  The server looks up
the AES key for the map (optionally per user) and then encrypts the bank, returning the bank file to the user's
client for local storage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="where-does-that-leave-us">
<h2>Where Does That Leave Us?</h2>
<p>As of July 2017, there is no way to prevent or detect users modifying bank files locally.  The best methods available
today involve multiple layers of obfuscation: post-processing galaxy scripts to replace variable names and
strings with random data, and encode simple values such as levels or mineral quantities using complex functions that
are hard to debug.  AES is not worth the time at all, since obfuscating the encryption secret is equally as hard as
obfuscating a custom encoding scheme.</p>
<p>Map authors that want to prevent (or at least detect) user modifications should petition Blizzard to provide APIs
for encrypting or storing bank files.  While the latter is the best user experience (no longer using local storage
means banks can persist across computers) it may be easier to first get Blizzard to expose apis for encrypting and
decrypting individual values or whole banks.  Although bank files would still be stored locally, keeping the secret
keys away from the users (and map authors, or you're in for some good old social engineering and password resets)
locks them out of modifying the bank file.</p>
<p>With asymmetric encryption users could even read banks offline using a public key downloaded with the map; Blizzard
still holds the private key and is the only one that can write changes to the local file.  A more complex model could
allow the user to have a copy of the bank in offline write mode, where they can write and encrypt changes to a local
copy with their own private key, but those changes are never persisted back to the server.</p>
